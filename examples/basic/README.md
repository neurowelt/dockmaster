# Docker Master - Example

In this example we simply run a Python 3.8 image with a simple worker script that prints out the `API_KEY` variable passed during build and a simple progress information.

You can run this example by executing the following command:

```bash
cd example
bash ../dockmaster.sh -c example/config.ini
```
